{% docs table_base_incremental_manifest %}

This incremental table is a manifest of the timestamp of the latest event consumed per model within the `snowplow-normalize` package as well as any models leveraging the incremental framework provided by the package. The latest event's timestamp is based off `collector_tstamp`. This table is used to determine what events should be processed in the next run of the model.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs table_base_new_event_limits %}

This table contains the lower and upper timestamp limits for the given run of the normalize model. These limits are used to select new events from the events table.

{% enddocs %}


{% docs table_base_events_this_run %}

For any given run, this table contains all required events to be consumed by subsequent nodes in the Snowplow dbt normalize package. This is a cleaned, deduped dataset, containing all columns from the raw events table.

**Note: This table should be used as the input to any custom modules that require event level data, rather than selecting straight from `atomic.events`**

{% enddocs %}

{% docs table_events %}

The `events` table contains all canonical events generated by [Snowplow's](https://snowplow.io/) trackers, including web, mobile and server side events.
