-- data_snowplow_delete_from_manifest_staging is manifest table to delete from.
-- data_snowplow_delete_from_manifest is the manifest table to select from to get the
-- expected results
-- Note: Test covers functionality however when running the macro on-run-start hook,
-- transaction behaviour changes.
-- Wrapped delete statement in transation so it commits. BQ wouldnt just support
-- 'commit;' without opening trans. Snowflake behaviour untested.
