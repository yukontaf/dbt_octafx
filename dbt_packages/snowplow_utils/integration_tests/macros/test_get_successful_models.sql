{# get_successful_models() macro requires the run_results object. This is only generated at the end of the run.
  This macro is intended to be run on a 'on-run-end' hook, so the run_results object is present.
  It is possible to hardcode a run_results object, however the schema for this object can evolve with time.
  By letting dbt generate the object, we ensure we are testing against the correct schema.
